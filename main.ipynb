    "First, we initialise our model. In TensorFlow, this consists of declaring the operations (and relationships thereof) required to compute the forward pass (from input to loss function) of the model (see `src/cnn.py`). Note that this is done in a declarative fashion, and it may be counter-intuitive that this code is only run once to initialise the computational graph. Actual forward passes are performed via a `tf.Session()` variable, with mini-batches passed through the graph to a nominal reference node (for example, the loss node). TensorFlow then knows how to backpropagate through each graph operation. This paradigm has its drawbacks, however, as it is highly verbose, and error traces are often opaque. `PyTorch`, a TensorFlow alternative, addresses this problem by keeping everything interpreted."
